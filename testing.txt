Testing strategy for project 1:

1. First use the provided test case to test program
2. Create a simple test case (sum.s) to understand how to create .dump file
3. Create a more complex test case that has memory loads and stores
    -Use first data memory slot to store length of an array, n
    -Use the next n data memory slots to store values(1, 2, 3,..., n)
4. Create a final test case that uses all remaining untested instructions
